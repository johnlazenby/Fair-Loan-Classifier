# Fair Loan Classifier

This is the final project for MIT 15.095 - Machine Learning Under a Robust Optimization Lens by John Lazenby and Kiran Gite <br>

The goal of the project is to develop a classifying approach that is more fair for minority borrowers, and to investigate the performance implications of increasing fairness. We find fairness can be improved without sacrificing much performance by adding holistic fairness constraints to a SVM classifier.

See the write up `Fairness in Mortgage Approvals.pdf` for additional details.

## Data
We pulled data for Bank of America, Navy Federal Credit Union, and Flagstar Bank for 2017-2019 from the [FFIEC website](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-publication/modified-lar/2019). The results in the writeup come from Flagstar Bank's 2019 portfolio.
